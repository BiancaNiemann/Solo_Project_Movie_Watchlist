# Scrimba Movie Watchlist Solo Project

## About

An app to make searching for and saving movies, we would like to watch in future easier.

Using
- Html
- Css
- Javascript
- API's

## What I learnt

 - Using API's to fetch the movie data from omdbapi.com
 - manipulating the recieved data so that I was able to render it how I needed on the screen
 - As an added feature I put a sort feature for the user to sort both alphabetically and by rating
